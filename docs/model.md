## Data model

This is a simplified data model of the data model of the Mercator.

[<img src="/mercator/images/model.png" width="700">](images/model.png)


## GDPR

The GDPR view contains all the data required to maintain the data processing register, and provides a link with the
processes, applications, and information used by the information system.

This view is used to fulfill the obligations set out in article 30 of the GDPR.

There is no direct relation between `data_processing` and `security_controls` within this view: both tables are
linked to processes and applications, which belong to other views (see [Business view](#business) and
[Applications view](#applications)).

### Register

The register of processing activities contains the information required by article 30.1 of the GDPR.

The field "controls" is not used and therefore is absent in the app.

The data model export lists processes, information, applications and documents
linked to a data processing.

In the app, a process can be linked to a data processing from a data processing object.  
An information can be linked with a data processing from a data processing object.

An application can be linked to a data processing from a data processing object.  
A document can be linked to a data processing from a data processing object.

### Security measures

This table identifies the security measures applied to processes and applications.

By default, this table is populated with the security measures of ISO 27001:2022.

| deleted_at  | timestamp    | Date of deletion    |

## Ecosystem

The ecosystem view describes all the entities or systems that revolve around the information system considered in the
mapping.

This view not only delimits the scope of the mapping, but also provides an overall view of the ecosystem without being
limited to the individual study of each entity.

### Entities

Entities are a part of the organization (e.g.: subsidiary, department, etc.) or related to the information system to be
mapped.

Entities are departments, suppliers, partners with whom information is exchanged through relationships.

| deleted_at       | timestamp    | Date of deletion                           |

The "external_ref_id" field is not used and therefore is missing in the app.

The data model export lists processes and applications linked with an entity.

In the app, a process can be linked with an entity from these two objects.  
An application can be linked with an entity (as operations manager) from these two objects.

In the app, a database can be linked with an entity (as operations manager) from these two objects.

### Relationships

Relationships represent a link between two entities or systems.

Relationships are contracts, service agreements, legal obligations... that have an influence on the information system.

| deleted_at         | timestamp    | Date of deletion                           |

In the app, the field for the authenticity need ("security_need_auth") is hidden by default. It is mandatory for
entities subject to the regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA).  
This default configuration can be changed in the menu Configuration > Parameters.

The data model export lists the reference documents attached to a relationship.  
In the application, a document can be attached to a relationship from a relationships object.

The financial values of a contract can be indicated in dedicated fields.

## Business

The business view of the information system describes all the organization's business processes and the players
involved, independently of the technological choices made by the organization and the resources made available to it.

The business view is essential, as it allows you to reposition technical elements in their business environment, and
thus understand their context of use.

In the application, a process can be linked with a macro-process from these two objects.

### Processes

Processes are a set of activities designed to achieve a goal. The process produces value-added information (
output) (in the form of deliverables) from information (input) produced by other processes.

Processes are made up of activities, entities involved in this process, and information processed by this process.

The data model export lists:

- entities,
- activities,
- information,
- applications,
- data processing,
- and security measures

linked to a process.

In the application, an entity associated with a process can be linked with a process from these two objects.  
An activity can be linked with a process from these two objects.  
An information can be linked with a process from these two objects.

An application can be linked with a process from these two objects.  
A GDPR registry data processing can be linked with a process from a registry data processing object.

A security measure can be linked with an application from the "Assign security controls" button.  
This button is in the GDPR view and visible in the list of Security controls objects.

### Activities

An activity is a step required to carry out a process. It corresponds to a specific know-how and not necessarily to an
organizational structure of the company.

The field "retention" is not used and therefore is absent in the app.

In the app, the field for the authenticity need ("security_need_auth") is hidden by default. It is mandatory for
entities subject to the regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA).  
This default configuration can be changed in the menu Configuration > Parameters.

The data model export lists databases and processes linked with information.

In the app, a database can be linked with an information from the object "database".  
A process can be linked to an information from these two objects.

*Note: The link to processes is a view of the result generated through the endpoint [processes](#processes) and its
field **informations***

## Applications

The application view is used to describe part of what is classically referred to as the "computer system".

This view describes the technological solutions that support business processes, mainly applications.

### Applications blocks

An application block represents a set of applications.

An application block can be: office applications, management applications, analysis applications, development
applications, etc.

| Table                                                  | api                       |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| <span style="color: blue;">*application-blocks*</span> | `/api/application-blocks` |

| Field       | Type         | Description                       |
|:------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------|
| id          | int unsigned | auto_increment                    |
| ext_refs | varchar(255) | External reference(s) to objects in other systems. Format: {ID_SOURCE}ID_OBJECT, multiple values separated by "\|" |
| name        | varchar(255) | Name of information               |
| description | longtext     | Description of application block  |

| deleted_at  | timestamp    | Date of deletion                  |

In the app, an application can be linked to an application block from these two objects.

### Applications

An application is a coherent set of IT objects (executables, programs, data, etc.). It is a grouping of application
services.

An application can be deployed on one or more logical servers.

When there is no virtualized environment, there are not several logical servers per physical server, but one logical
server per physical server.

RTO : *Recovery Time Objective*  
RPO : *Recovery Point Objective*

The "patching_frequency" and "next_update" fields are not used at the moment and are therefore missing from the
application.

In the app, the need for authentication is hidden by default. It is mandatory in the case
from an entity subject to EU Directive 2022/2554 (DORA).  
It is activated from the Configuration > Settings menu.

In the app, a container can be linked with an application from these two objects.  
In the app, the *major events* field is managed in a separate table.

#### Major events

Major events are the main events undergone by an application during its operation.  
Major events are only accessible through application objects.

They are neither importable nor exportable through the graphics tool.

### Applications services

An application service is a specific service provided to a user to perform specific tasks related to their role in the
organisation.

Eg. an application service could be a Cloud service or platform.

The data model export lists the applications and application modules linked with an application service.

In the app, an application can be linked with an application service from these two objects.  
In the app, an application module can be linked with an application service from these two objects.

There are two fields containing the same information in the data model export, *servicesApplications* and
*applications*.  
The connection with application objects is made through the *applications* field.

### Application modules

An application module is a component of an application characterized by functional coherence and technological
homogeneity.

| Table                                                   | api                        |

| deleted_at           | timestamp    | Date of deletion                          |

The export of the data model lists application services linked with an application module.

In the app, an application service can be linked to an application module from these two objects.

### Databases

A database is a set of structured and ordered information meant for computed processing.

| Table                                         | api              |

| deleted_at         | timestamp    | Date of deletion             |

In the app, the field for the authenticity need ("security_need_auth") is hidden by default. It is mandatory for
entities subject to the regulation (EU) 2022/2554 (DORA).  
This default configuration can be changed in the menu Configuration > Parameters.

The data model export references the specific icon of a database.  
In the app, a specific icon can be linked with a database from a database object.

The data model export lists entities using the database (*entities* field), applications, information,
logical servers and containers linked with a database.

In the app, a user entity can be linked with a database from a database object.  
In the app, an information can be linked with a database from a database object.

In the app, an application can be linked with a database from these two objects.  
In the app, a logical server can be linked with a database from these two objects.  
In the app, a container can be linked with a database from these two objects.

### Application Flows

An application flow is an exchange of information between a sender and a receiver (application, application service,
application module, or database).

An application flow represents an exchange of information between two elements of the information system. It is
important to avoid representing all firewall filtering rules in terms of flows.

For example, DNS or NTP requests should not be represented as flows.

## Administration

The administration view lists the management of resources, directories, and user privilege levels within the information system.

Having directories and centralized user access rights is strongly recommended for operators of vital importance (OIVs).

*Nota*: OVI is coming from the French military programme law. The closest equivalents in EU regulations are OES
(Operators of Essential Services, EU 2016/1148, NIS) and EE (Essential Entities, EU 2022/2555, NIS 2).

### Administration zone

An administration zone is a set of resources (people, data, equipment) under the responsibility of one (or more)
administrator(s).

An administration zone is made up of Active Directory (AD) directory services and forests, or LDAP trees.

### Administration directory services

An administration directory service is an application that collects data on a company's users or IT equipment, enabling
them to be administered.

It can be an inventory tool used to manage changes or tickets, or a mapping tool such as Mercator. It can optionally be
linked to the application implementing it.

| deleted_at            | timestamp    | Date of deletion                        |

The data model esport lists AD forests / LDAP trees linked with an AD domain / LDAP.

In the app, an AD forest / LDAP tree can be linked with an AD domain / LDAP from these two objects.  
A logical server can be linked with an AD domain / LDAP from these two objects.

### Users

Users are user accounts with privileged rights on IT systems.

## Logical infrastructure

The logical infrastructure view corresponds to the logical distribution of the network.

It illustrates the partitioning of networks and the logical links between them. It also lists the network equipment that
handles the traffic.

### Backup Plans

Backup plans allow you to associate the **implemented backup strategies** with each **logical server**.  
These strategies describe:  
- the **storage infrastructure** used to receive the backup,  
- the **backup frequency** (daily, weekly, monthly…),  
- the **backup type** (full, incremental…),  
- the **retention period**, expressed in days.

This table serves as the reference for auditing backup compliance, identifying unprotected servers, and verifying that backup strategies match availability and restoration requirements.

The data model export lists applications, databases, and logical servers linked with a container.

In the app, an application can be linked to a container from these two objects.  
A database can be linked to a container from these two objects.  
A logical server can be linked to a container from a container object.

### Logical flows

Logical flows describe relationships at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model.

### Certificates

Electronic certificates are used to identify and authenticate services and individuals, as well as to encrypt exchanges.

Certificates are SSL keys, HTTPS certificates, etc. They are associated with logical servers or applications.

* Note:
    * status = 0 : "Good"
    * status = 1 : "Revoked"
    * status = 2 : "Unknown"

The "last_notification" field is not used and therefore is absent in the app.

The data model export lists applications and logical servers linked with a certificate.

### VLANs

A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) or virtual LAN enables equipment to be logically grouped together, free from
physical constraints.

| created_at  | timestamp    | Date of creation    |
| updated_at  | timestamp    | Date of update      |
| deleted_at  | timestamp    | Date of deletion    |

The data model export lists physical routers and logical network switches linked to a VLAN.

In the app, a VLAN can be linked to a physical router from a physical router object.  
In the app, a VLAN can be linked to a subnet from these two objects.  
In the app, a VLAN can be linked to a logic switch from these two objects.

## Physical infrastructure

The physical infrastructure view describes the physical equipment that makes up or is used by the information system.

This view corresponds to the geographical distribution of network equipment within the various sites.
