# Exploration Feature

The **Exploration** tool (`Tools → Exploration`) allows you to dynamically navigate through the asset relationship
graph. It reveals dependencies between layers: upward (abstract / business) or downward (concrete / physical).

## 1. Interface

## 2. Understanding the Filter Field

> ⚠️ **Critical point**: the Filter field has a dual effect that is essential to understand before exploring the graph.

### 2.1 Effect 1 — Restricting the "Object" dropdown list

This is the most intuitive use. By entering a view in the Filter field (e.g. `Applications`), the "Object" dropdown will
only display assets belonging to that view. This avoids having to search for an asset across the entire CMDB.

### 2.2 Effect 2 — Limiting asset visibility in the graph (a common pitfall)

This is the least expected effect, and the most frequent source of errors. **The filter does not simply restrict the "
Object" list: it also determines which asset types will be displayed in the graph during exploration.**

In practice: if you explore a `logical-server` with only `Logical Infrastructure` in the filter, any applications linked
to that server will **never** appear in the graph, even if they exist in Mercator and are correctly associated. They are
simply excluded because their type is not covered by the active filter.

**Illustrated example:**

| Active filter                             | Explored asset         | Result in the graph                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Logical Infrastructure`                  | `LOGICAL-SERVER-RH-11` | Visible: `NETWORK-CORE-11`, `SUBNET-CORE-11`, `SUBNET-VIRT-111` — but not `RH-Solution` |
| `Applications` + `Logical Infrastructure` | `LOGICAL-SERVER-RH-11` | Also visible: `RH-Solution` and `DB-RH-PROD`                                            |
| *(empty)*                                 | Any asset              | All linked assets are visible, across all layers                                        |

[<img src="/mercator/images/exploration_filtre_infra.png" width="700">](images/exploration_filtre_infra.png)
*With filter "Logical Infrastructure" only: RH-Solution does not appear.*

[<img src="/mercator/images/exploration_filtre_full.png" width="700">](images/exploration_filtre_full.png)
*With filters "Applications" + "Logical Infrastructure": RH-Solution and DB-RH-PROD appear.*

### 2.3 Practical rule: which filter should I use?

| Objective                                                 | Recommended filter                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Quickly find an asset in a specific view                  | Enter only the targeted view (e.g. `Applications`) |
| Cross-layer exploration (application + infrastructure)    | Enter **all** relevant views, or leave empty       |
| Full impact analysis (all layers)                         | **Leave the filter empty** to exclude nothing      |
| Exploration limited to a single layer (e.g. network only) | Enter only that layer's view                       |

> 💡 **Tip**: when in doubt about what you are looking for, always start with an **empty** filter. You can narrow it down
> afterwards if the graph becomes too dense.

## 3. Semantics of Directional Buttons

The direction is relative to the **Mercator layer hierarchy**, aligned with ArchiMate:

```
↑ UP    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════  toward 100 (Business)
         Layer 1: Entities, Processes, Actors       (100–260)
         Layer 2: Applications, Modules, DBs        (300–340)
         Layer 3: IAM, Active Directory             (400–460)
         Layer 4: Networks, VMs, Containers         (500–580)
         Layer 5: Physical, Sites, Racks            (600–675)
↓ DOWN  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════  toward 675 (Physical)
```

| Button     | Direction           | Meaning                                                                             | Example from `HR-Solution`                         |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **↑ Up**   | Toward upper layers | Navigates up to the business layer, processes, and actors that use this asset       | `Application → HR Process → HR Director Actors`    |
| **↓ Down** | Toward lower layers | Navigates down to the infrastructure, servers, and networks that support this asset | `Application → VM → Physical Server → Rack → Site` |
| **↕ Both** | Bidirectional       | Full view: who uses this asset AND what it relies on                                | `Process ← Application → Server → Physical`        |

**Expected result:**

```
HR-Solution
 ├── APPLI-HR-SRV-1 (application service)
 └── DB-HR-PROD (database)
      └── VM-APP-HR-01 (logical server)
           └── SRV-PROD-01 (physical server)
                └── RACK-A3 (rack)
                     └── Site DC-Paris
```

You obtain the complete chain from the application down to the physical site.

**Expected result:**

```
         Macro-process: Personnel Management
              └── HR Process → HR Director Actor
                       ↑
              [HR-Solution]  ← central asset
                       ↓
         APPLI-HR-SRV-1 · APPLI-HR-MOD-1 · DB-HR-PROD
              └── Logical Servers → Physical → Racks → Site
```

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Exploration Recommendations

**Start with level 1 or 2**
For highly connected assets (e.g., a central application), starting with 1 or 2 levels avoids an unreadable graph.
Increase progressively from there.

**Use the filter to target specific views**
The Filter field restricts available objects to a specific view, avoiding the need to search through the entire CMDB.

**Physical Mode**
Enable the Physical toggle only when you want to visualize physical network links (WAN/LAN/MAN). When disabled, the
exploration stays at the logical level.

### 7.2 Asset Entry Recommendations

- Follow Mercator numbering: create assets from the physical layer (600+) before associating them to logical layers.
- Physical containment relationships must be entered in order: **Site → Building → Bay → Physical Server**.
- A `logical-server` (VM) must always be linked to a `physical-server` for ↓ Down navigation to work correctly.
- `certificates` (570) are cross-cutting: associate them to both applications AND logical servers for complete
  exploration.
- `external-connected-entities` (540) can be linked to the business layer (partners) or the network layer (connections)
  depending on context.

### 7.3 Use Cases by User Profile

| Profile                  | Preferred Direction | Typical Use Case                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enterprise Architect     | ↑ Up                | Tracing alignment between infrastructure and business processes |
| Infrastructure Architect | ↓ Down              | Identifying the physical chain supporting an application        |
| CISO / Risk Manager      | ↕ Both              | Mapping dependencies for risk analysis                          |
| CMDB Manager             | ↓ Down              | Verifying completeness of physical chaining                     |
| Crisis / DRP Manager     | ↕ Both              | Impact analysis before/after an incident                        |
