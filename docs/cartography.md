## Views

The cartography is made up of three views progressively moving from business to technical, themselves broken down into views:

### GDPR view

The GDPR view is used to maintain the register of processing operations and to make the link with the processes, information, applications and security measures in place. 

### Business view

The ecosystem view presents the various entities or systems with which the IS interacts to fulfill its function.

The business view of the information system represents the IS through its main processes and information, which are the business values as defined by the EBIOS Risk Manager risk assessment method.

### Application view

The application view describes the information system's software components, the services they provide and the data flows between them.

The application flow view describes the information flows between different applications, services, modules and databases.

### Administrative view

The administration view lists the perimeters and privilege levels of users and administrators.

### Loggical view

The logical infrastructure view illustrates the logical partitioning of networks, notably through the definition of IP address ranges, VLANs and filtering and routing functions;

### Infrastructure view

The physical infrastructure view describes the physical equipment that makes up or is used by the information system.

## Maturity levels

The maturity levels represent the percentage of completeness of the mapping. It is an indicator of the effort remaining to be provided to achieve complete mapping.

This maturity is divided into three levels:

* The minimum level 1 granularity which contains the information essential to the cartography;
* Level 2 intermediate granularity which contains important information for mapping;
* Level 3 fine granularity which contains useful information for the management of information system security.

## Security needs

Information security needs are expressed in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability with the following scale:

| Level | Description | Color |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| 0| Insignificant | White |
| 1 | Low | <span style="color:green">Green</span> |
| 2 | Medium | <span style="color:yellow;">Yellow</span> |
| 3 | Strong | <span style="color:orange">Orange</span> |
| 4 | Very strong | <span style="color:red">Red</span> |
