Information System (IS) mapping is an essential tool for mastering your information system (IS), and is mandatory for
Operators of Vital Importance ([OIV](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9rateur_d%27importance_vitale)). Mapping your
IS enables you to know all the elements that make it up, so as to gain a better understanding of it, and therefore
better control over it. It forms part of an overall risk management approach.

- [ArchiMate 3.1](https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview)

Archimate is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language developed by The Open Group. It provides
a standardized framework for describing, analyzing, and visualizing the relationships between business processes,
information systems, and technology infrastructure across an organization. ArchiMate structures its models across three
main layers — Business, Application, and Technology — enabling architects to represent how strategic goals translate
into concrete IT components. Its integration with TOGAF and compatibility with tools like Archi make it a reference
standard for enterprise architects seeking a unified view of organizational complexity.

- [TOGAF ADM](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf)

TOGAF ADM (The Open Group Architecture Framework – Architecture Development Method) is one of the most widely adopted
enterprise architecture frameworks in the world. Developed and maintained by The Open Group, it provides a structured,
iterative methodology for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information architectures. The ADM
cycle guides architects through a series of phases — from preliminary preparation and architecture vision to business,
information systems, and technology architecture definition, culminating in implementation governance and architecture
change management. TOGAF is particularly valued for its flexibility, allowing organizations to tailor the framework to
their specific context while maintaining alignment between business strategy and IT capabilities.
